# Overview

I really enjoyed learning the Kotlin Language, what I would like to do with this in the future is to create my own apps.

The program I wrote is a contact manager, basically a spot to add contacts(Name, Phone, Email) and to be able to see all or search through them.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Item 1 In the module it asks to write an edit function, so I would like to learn that and add it in.
- Item 2 I want to create android apps in the future using this language. Which one of my sprints I want to make a mobile app using the language.
- Item 3 Right now the contact manager doesn't save the list when you end it. I want to figure out how to save the list for the future purpose.
